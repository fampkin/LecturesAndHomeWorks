      "\n",
      "there are many versions of “buttercream” icing. some are made with eggs and all butter.  some varieties, you have to cook your sugar to a softball stage.  others are 100% shortening or a combination of shortening and butter.\n",
      "\n",
      "each decorator has his or her favorite.  i personally think that the best taste and textured recipe is the one that has you cook your sugar, add to whipped eggs and use pounds of butter per batch. but…. i live in a state that can easily be a 100 degrees for days on end during the summer and you know what butter does on hot days.  it melts!  a greasy puddle of melted icing on a cake plate is not something i want to look at or eat.  \n",
      "\n",
      "your top notch decorators have a few options we don’t.  they have huge refrigerators to store their cakes in, and refrigerated vehicles that they can use to deliver decorated cakes. i even know a few that refuse to deliver at all. if you want their cake, you come and get it and it’s your responsibility if it melts.  these decorators don’t even turn on their ovens for a wedding cake for less than $2000.  \n",
      "\n",
      "the following recipes for buttercream icing hold up pretty well in the heat and humidity, but if you know that your cake will be out in very high temperatures, then don’t use any butter and use only a high quality shortening.  \n",

      "shortening:  \n",
      "\n",
      "solid shortenings definitely have their place in baking. so i’m going to talk taste tests. crisco is the hands down winner. it has a clean taste with the melting point of 106 degrees. butter melts somewhere between 88 and 98 degrees f. depending on the amount of fat in the brand.  you can see that if you need to serve a pure buttercream decorated cake, on a hot august afternoon, you could have melted roses (and i do mean greasy puddles) on the tablecloth. this is when a good quality shortening will be a great blessing. i have been told by decorator friends that some of the warehouse brand shortenings leave a grainy consistency to the icing no matter what you do.  \n",

      "powdered (confectioner's) sugar:  \n",
      "\n",
      "regarding powdered sugar. please use a cane sugar. i prefer c&h powdered (confectioners) sugar.  many of the cheaper brands use sugar beets for their base.  i don’t know the chemistry behind it but you definitely get different textures to your icing that can vary from batch to batch.  i spent a few months being very frustrated with the quality of my icing until a kind lady did a bit of trouble shooting for me. she recommended the cane sugar and i’ve been blessing her ever since.\n",

      "please be safe, buy a quality brands and then stick with it for the best results. a friend of mine, who is a wonderful cook and baker, travels a lot and she often prepares treats for her hosts. she’s learned to ask the host to have her favorite shortening and flour on hand. she has even made up a little makeup type case that carries her favorite extracts and precious spices. that way she knows what she is working with, how it handles, and what tastes she can expect for the finished product. some surprises are not pleasant. \n",

      "storing buttercream icing: \n",
      "\n",
      "if you are not going to be using the icing right away, place it in a clean, sealable bowl. store it in the refrigerator but please don’t place it next to the marinating salmon, garlic or broccoli.  you do not want those flavors in your icing!  i like to use my icing within a few days but it will hold in the cold refrigerator for a couple of weeks if necessary.  \n",
      "\n",
      "i often make a double batch of icing the night before i have a baking project.  that way i know that i have plenty of icing, it’s fresh and i don’t have to make it while i’m in the middle of baking the cakes.  the extra can always be used for a batch of cupcakes.\n",
      "\n",
      "when you remove the icing from the refrigerator, you might notice that the icing has taken on a sponge like texture. do yourself a favor and place the icing in a bowl and mix by hand using a back and forth, smashing motion with a spoon or icing spatula. what you want to do is to smash the bubbles out of the icing. this extra step will help to give you the smoothest icing for a pretty top and sides of the cake. i have found that you will get an even better texture of icing if it is at room temperature before you try to do your icing.\n",
      "\n",
      "bad buttercream icing days:  \n",
      "\n",
      "one thing that seems very silly but is true. there are bad buttercream days! i’ve asked quite a few decorators about this and every one says “yes, there are lousy days”. i’m not sure what causes the problem. \n",
      "\n",
      "it could be that every human has bad days so they blame the buttercream. \n",
      "\n",
      "it may be the humidity or that there is a low pressure system hanging over your town. \n",
      "\n",
      "i just know why but it is a perceived fact. the way i have handled the problem is that i changed the decoration on the cake.  i couldn’t get the smooth top or sides as i originally planned. writing a greeting on a messy top would look awful so i changed the design idea and put flowers everywhere. i could have also done a basket weave technique around the sides. just go with the flow, and don’t get frustrated. aunt martha won’t chuck the cake at you if you don’t write her name on the top this time. remember that you are creating something that is to be eaten so have fun with it.  \n",

      "different mixers:\n",

      "\n",
      "i also prefer to mix the buttercream on a low setting. it seems that the higher setting do the job faster but you also will get a spongy texture to the icing. i don’t want that quality in my final ice coating or flowers on the cake. \n",

      "Описание: a translucent golden-brown crust allows the green of the avocado to be seen.  the crispy exterior is a counterpoint to the unctuous interior.  these are a signature dish for me, and the one i most often get requests to make (although my seafood and ricotta stuffed buckwheat pancakes run a close second).\n",
      "\n",
      "these fritters came about ten years ago when i was shopping for a dinner i was making for a friend who is a cia-trained chef.  i was in a vegetable market and saw these gorgeous avocados that i just knew would be ripe in the next two days.  i tried to think of what i could do with them since a) everyone serves cold avocado, and b) i really am not fond of guacamole.  as i tried to think of what i could make with them that was hot, the work 'fritters' jumped into my head.  having never made a fritter before, i was a little surprised to have that thought; but having never known when a vegetable was going to be ripe before i figured i was on a roll and decided to go for it.\n",
      "\n",
      "to serve with my never-before-tried-fritters, i decided to make a crème fraîche-lime-cayenne dipping sauce.  so i made fresh crème fraîche, and used it as a base not only for this dip, but for a tia maria sauce to go with the flourless chocolate cake i made for dessert (another never-before made item, but with the recipe from cook's illustrated it was the only thing i wasn't making up as i went along).\n",
      "\n",
      "the result of the fritters was that i got to taste the test fritter, then had to dive across the couch before the last one was devoured in order to have a second.\n",
      "\n",
      "the one evolution in the recipe is the change from cayenne to chipotle in the dip.  i like the smokiness, and it gives a rough edge to something very smooth - i am all about contrast.  feel free to use whatever chile or combination thereof that you like best.  this dip is easy and stands on it's own at a party for anything you want to dip into it.  i have also made it with vegan sour cream with great results.\n",

      "\n",
      "(for those not familiar with the name alligator pear, it derives from both the tough, textured exterior - reminiscent of an alligator's hide, and the fact that you really can't eat one until it softens - just like a pear.)\n",
      "\n",
      "alligator claws are also a great name to call them if you have kids who either won't eat anything that sounds weird and you want to keep them to yourself, or - if you want your kids to eat them - if you have kids who'll only eat things that will gross other people out.\n",
      "\n",
      "if you are preparing these for kids (and i recommend you do whatever name you choose to call them), protect their palates and tone down the heat of the sauce.  maybe skip the chiles altogether and put in just a hint of finely ground pepper (white pepper won't look like black specks throughout the dip - i'm normally not that fussy, but it's something kids will notice).\n",
      "\n",
      "allow half an avocado per person.  this is so rich that more is too much.\n",

      "Описание: this is one of the best soups i've ever made and it is even worthy of company.  so simple, yet rich in deep, mushroomy flavor.  the inspiration was zaar #26877, a delicious mushroom rice casserole.  i found i couldn't stop eating the liquid before putting the casserole into the oven and that gave me the idea that the base  would make a delicious soup.  and it does! \n",
      "use plenty of fresh mushrooms.  i buy them when they are marked 1/2 price at the grocery, as this is a good way to use your 'shrooms that are starting to get dark.  it is the soy sauce that transforms the broth from ho-hum to yum.  i try to use low sodium or home-made no sodium chicken broth so that i can use the soy for the sodium.  there is no sense of \"asian\" in this soup at all.  ( i would not make this without the soy. )  just a little bit adds the depth of flavor and even color that transforms the soup.\n",

      "3. i did do this recipe with sinewy beef scraps cut from a roast once.  i browned the beef in the bottom of the pan, added the butter and onions and continued as written.  the beef added great color and flavor.  in this case, i threw the beef piece away, because it had too much sinew, but it was a great addition!  i ended up using less soy.\n",
      "\n",

      "Описание: the first time i made this cake i grated a million pounds of carrots on a knucklebuster.  then they invented cuisinarts!  now it is much faster to shred the carrots on a fine shredding disk and no bloody knuckles!  i have baked it in 8\", 9\", 9x13\" pans so if you want to experiment with pan size it works.  one thing i found was baking and stacking the three layers is tricky.  my favorite way is two 8\" pans for a nice layer cake and an 8\" square pan to put into the freezer for unexpected company. i hope you try this wonderful cake.  update:  in the spirit of carrot cake stories, this cake was invented by a bunny named foo-foo.  he is very famous and even has a hit song which goes like this: sing to the tune of 'down by the station'..........     \n",
